# Dominos-Discout-Codes

Dominos pizza uses discount codes that are numbers of 4 digits (this is the case in France, can be different in other countries). This script tries them all and writes the ones that provide a discount + the discount in a text file.

Adapt the script to the OS you're running the script on. (for selenium)
